These are some handy utility functions for doing things to vectors
(in the math sense, though they are also represented by Clojure vectors).
And some other math that may or may not be related to munging data.

Many examples come from _Mining of Massive Datasets_
by Jure Leskovec, Anand Rajaraman, and Jeffrey D. Ullman.

Names are short.  Test coverage is minimal.
I wrote these functions for my own use in the REPL.
There are probably errors.  There are certainly un-handled edge cases.
