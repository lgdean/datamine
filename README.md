These are some handy utility functions for doing things to vectors
(in the math sense, though they are also represented by Clojure vectors).
And some other math that may or may not be related to munging data.

(Keeping it vague because some of these functions were inspired by a class
(in the academic sense, not the Java sense).  I don't think posting them
runs afoul of the honor code, as they are general-purpose functions,
and if you can use them to answer questions, then you probably understand
the material just fine.  Nevertheless, that's why I kept it vague.
I also won't post publicly until this instance of the class has ended.)

Names are short.  Test coverage is minimal.
I wrote these functions for my own use in the REPL.
There are probably errors.  There are certainly un-handled edge cases.
